## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### PHP and Mysql version

```
PHP 7.3.11
mysql  Ver 5.7.29
```

### JWT private and public key generation commands (Find the passphrase in .env file)

```
mkdir -p config/jwt
openssl genpkey -out config/jwt/private.pem -aes256 -algorithm rsa -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
openssl pkey -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/public.pem -pubout
```

### To get the JWT token

Launch this command :

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/api/login_check \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"username":"test@test.com",
	"password": "123456"

It returns a json giving the JWT token
